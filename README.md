🏦 Parabank CI/CD Quality Framework
This repo showcases a modular, automation-ready framework designed to validate core banking workflows for Parabank. Built to highlight robust integration of GitHub Actions, this project demonstrates scalable test design, dynamic reporting, and quality-first CI/CD practices.

Whether you're reviewing loan applications or account transfers, the goal is simple: build pipelines and tests that teams actually trust.

🔧 Technologies: Playwright, GitHub Actions, Python, YAML

📊 Features: Automated test execution, CI/CD integration, logging & reporting strategies

🏃‍♂️ Bonus: Developed between training runs for half marathons—because quality and endurance go hand in hand.

📘 Test Strategy & Methodology
This framework leverages Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) triggers as a foundational technique to inform and prioritize test case design. By analyzing defect types and their root causes, ODC enables actionable insights that drive targeted validation across Parabank’s core workflows.
ODC-based triggers were used to model scenarios such as:

- Input validation failures in loan applications
- Timing inconsistencies during account transactions
- Data mapping errors in customer profile updates

This method ensures the test suite goes beyond surface-level checks to uncover systemic patterns and optimize defect detection with purpose.
