**Overview**

This repo is an overview of the type of work that I have performed, managed and lead during the SDLC of products that I have been apart of. The over arching philosphy is to perform shift-left testing, having the test team involved starting at the requirements stage.

There is an associated project with the repo that has several tickets that demonstrate the type of user stories that are created during test grooming during sprints. The tickets are in various states and are currenlty being used to track products for this repo.

📘 Test Strategy & Methodology

This framework leverages Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) triggers as a foundational technique to inform and prioritize test case design. By analyzing defect types and their root causes, ODC enables actionable insights that drive targeted validation across Parabank’s core workflows.
ODC-based triggers were used to model scenarios such as:

- Input validation failures in loan applications
- Timing inconsistencies during account transactions
- Data mapping errors in customer profile updates

This method ensures the test suite goes beyond surface-level checks to uncover systemic patterns and optimize defect detection with purpose.

🔧 Technologies: Playwright, GitHub Actions, Python, YAML

📊 Features: Automated test execution, CI/CD integration, logging & reporting strategies

🏃‍♂️ Bonus: Developed between training runs for half marathons—because quality and endurance go hand in hand.

🏦 Parabank - Personal Work Demo Framework

The framework showcases a modular, automation-ready framework designed to validate core banking workflows for Parabank. Built to highlight robust integration of GitHub Actions, this project demonstrates scalable test design, dynamic reporting, and quality-first CI/CD practices.
